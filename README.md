# CMU-15-445-Database-Systems
Course homework and assignment.

Version 2022-Fall

I want to learn more about database and C++, so i found this online course for self learning.
Mainly for homework doing. Probably some note will be updated but not sure about it.

I updated homework 01 to my github. The coursework aim to build up some basic skill like search, sort in sqlite3. I have built up something new in the work.
Should notice there's something wrong with question 9, as it works but can not pass the code check. Someday I'll go back and check it again.
